# Using a Genetic Algorithm to Identify Co-morbidities

This github project is for the NICHDâ€™s *Decoding Maternal Morbidity Data Challenge*.

It uses a novel genetic algorithm to identify co-morbidities associated with a particular outcome (here maternal morbidities), by optimizing the risk ratio given different categorical inputs. 

Use notes:

 - To be replicated, all scripts need to be run from the root folder
 - The csv data for the nuMoM2b study (not uploaded to github), needs to be located at the `data/nuMoM2b.csv` to replicate the findings.
 - This uses python 3.7, and the libraries specified in `requirements.txt`. See that file for notes on creating your own conda environment to replicate.
 - The genetic algorithm does have stochastic elements, so your results may differ slightly from my results

The folder `/tech_docs` has more technical documentation on the genetic algorithm, but also note the source code for the functions is 100% provided in `/src/genrules.py`. 

The folder `/examples` provides several Jupyter notebooks that illustrate the results
